# :computer:  Hey! I'm Quinn! :computer: 

Full-stack developer with experience in frontend and backend technologies such as Ruby, Rails, Javascript, and React. After graduating from Denison University with a degree in Film and Communications, I immediately continued my education at Flatiron, jumping into web development as a way to explore and nurture the technical side of my brain. 

I bring strong skills in collaboration and teamwork, as well as a passion for creativity in everything I do. My background working on film sets gives me an alternative perspective and experience working in high-stress, deadline-driven, highly collaborative environments. In addition, I spent the summer of 2019 at the esteemed Second City in Chicago working through Columbia College's Comedy Studies program writing and performing a full sketch comedy show. I believe humor is an integral part of human connection and try to incorporate aspects of levity in everything I do.
